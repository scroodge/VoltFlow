# Backlog — proposed plans awaiting go-ahead

Per the agent workflow in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): **plan first, build only on explicit
go-ahead.** These are researched but **not built**. Shipped work lives in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 🔴 Revert BMS-for-cost code paths (correctness)

The BMS counter `kwh_charged` is battery-**cell** energy only (~47 % low vs grid) and
must not drive cost or the power display. Validated 2026-06-30 — see
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and [docs/CHARGING_SESSIONS.md](docs/CHARGING_SESSIONS.md).

**To revert:**
- `buildReconciledSessionPatch` — stop using `maxKwhCharged` for energy/cost; use
  `SOC_delta% × capacity ÷ 100` (efficiency ≈ 100 %).
- `useFloatChargePowerKw` wired into `vehicle-live-view.tsx` +
  `charging-session-screen.tsx` — revert (shows cell-side ~2.5 kW vs grid 4.6 kW).
- Keep `kwh_charged` in telemetry and the tested `deriveChargePowerFromEnergyDeltaKw`
  helper for diagnostics; just don't let them drive cost/power UI.

> This is the one backlog item that is a **bug**, not an enhancement. Prioritize it.

## 🟡 Partition `bydmate_telemetry_samples` by time (Plan A)

The high-volume ~1 Hz append-only table. Retention is `DELETE`-based (bloat + vacuum
pressure). **Plan B (BRIN index) is done** (see CHANGELOG). **Plan A (full declarative
range partitioning by `device_time`, monthly)** turns retention into `DROP PARTITION`
and shrinks indexes.

- Forces composite PK `(id, device_time)`; the existing unique
  `(user_id, vehicle_id, device_time)` already includes the partition key. ✅
- Subtle part: the prune rewrite — mixed retention tiers (free 30 d vs premium/admin
  forever) in one time partition means a hybrid of `DROP PARTITION` (past the longest
  tier) + per-user `DELETE` within retained partitions.
- Annotated, **not-applied** draft: [docs/PLAN_A_PARTITION_DRAFT.sql](docs/PLAN_A_PARTITION_DRAFT.sql).
- Needs user go-ahead **and** a pg_dump/host backup before applying.

Not urgent at current scale; worth doing before the userbase grows.

## 🔵 Promote `vehicle_id` to a real foreign key

`vehicle_id` is a soft `text` key across telemetry, trips, snapshots, commands, and
notifications (~36 occurrences), linked by `cars.vehicle_alias` (text) → `*.vehicle_id`
(text) string equality with **no referential integrity**. A typo or alias change
silently orphans data.

**Recommendation:** a real `vehicles` table (uuid PK), FK from all telemetry/trip/command
tables, keeping `vehicle_alias` as the external device id. Big, multi-RPC migration on
the hottest write path (ingest) — defensible to defer until the telemetry tables are
already being opened up (e.g. combine with the partitioning cutover above). Lower
priority than partitioning; build only if explicitly prioritized.

## Notes / smaller debt

- **Overlapping tariff columns on `profiles`:** legacy `default_price_per_kwh` coexists
  with `home/commercial_ac/fast_dc_price_per_kwh`. The legacy column could be retired.
- **`numeric` for telemetry** that doesn't need exact decimals — `real`/`double precision`
  would be smaller/faster (lat/lon already use `double precision` — inconsistent).
- **Client `isJunkTrip` vs server discard** are out of sync (server is authoritative);
  sync Rules B/C into `trip-filter.ts` only if phantoms surface in the UI. See
  [docs/TRIPS.md](docs/TRIPS.md).
